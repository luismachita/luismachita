I am a software engineer by trade, and an art and design enthusiast at heart. After a fulfilling career as a professor of design history, I turned back to software development - a longstanding, very serious interest of mine that predates most others.

Since then, Iâ€™ve helped design and ship all kinds of fun stuff alongside great colleagues.

The connecting thread across these experiences is a passion for architecture and design systems, especially a passion for the potential of modern systems to create new and effective experiences and provide solutions to difficult problems.
